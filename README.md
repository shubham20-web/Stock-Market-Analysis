#Stock Market Time Series Analysis & Forecasting

Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, ARIMA

Performed end-to-end time series analysis on historical stock market data to understand trends, volatility, and temporal patterns.

Conducted data cleaning and preprocessing, including datetime indexing, handling missing values, and transforming raw price data for analysis.

Applied Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check stationarity and used first-order differencing to stabilize the time series.

Built and trained an ARIMA forecasting model, selecting optimal parameters using ACF and PACF plots.

Evaluated model performance using RMSE and MAE, ensuring reliable short-term stock price forecasts.

Visualized actual vs predicted values to interpret model accuracy and trend capture.

Identified model limitations and proposed improvements using SARIMA and LSTM for advanced forecasting.
